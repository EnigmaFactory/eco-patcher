# EverCraft Online Patcher

The official patcher for EverCraft Online, built using Electron. This patcher ensures players have the latest version of the game by checking with the game's server for updates. If a newer version is detected, it downloads and extracts the necessary files. Once everything is up to date, the patcher launches the game.
